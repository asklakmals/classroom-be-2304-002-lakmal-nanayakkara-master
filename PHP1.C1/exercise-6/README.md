#Exercises
>Write a PHP program that prompts the user to enter their grade (out of 100) for a course and
>calculates their letter grade and percentage score based on a grading scale. The grading scale is
>as follows:
>A: 90-100, B: 80-89, C: 70-79, D: 60-69, F: 0-59
>Assume that the course is worth 3 credits and that the maximum possible points for the course is
>4.0 per credit. The program should use conditional statements to determine the user's letter grade
>and percentage score based on their grade, and should use arithmetic operators to calculate the
>user's percentage score based on the number of credits for the course. The program should then
>output a message that includes the user's grade, letter grade, and percentage score in the
>following format:
>"Your grade of X corresponds to a letter grade of Y and a percentage score of Z%."
>where X is the user's grade, Y is their letter grade, and Z is their percentage score rounded to two
>decimal places.

**Example:**
*Input: 88*
*Output: Your grade of 88 corresponds to a letter grade of B and a percentage score of 75%*
