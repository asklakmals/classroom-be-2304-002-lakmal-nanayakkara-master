#Exercises
>Task: Implement a program in PHP that sorts an array of integers using different sorting algorithms. The
>program should use a function to generate a random array of integers and display the unsorted and sorted
>arrays.
>Here are the requirements for the program:
>The program should prompt the user for the number of elements to generate in the array. Use a function to
>generate an array of random integers based on the user's input. Display the unsorted array to the user. Sort this
>array with Bubble Sort algorithm. Display the sorted array to the user.

**Here's an example of the expected output:**
*Enter the number of elements to generate: 10*
*Unsorted Array:*
*[72, 15, 69, 1, 62, 95, 8, 51, 55, 39]*
*Sorted Array:*
*[1, 8, 15, 39, 51, 55, 62, 69, 72, 95]
*Note: You have to implement the sorting algorithm using your own logic. DO NOT use PHP built-in functions or*
*any other libraries.*
