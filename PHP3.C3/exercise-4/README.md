#Practical Task

**Task: Use the script development for lesson 3 assignment. Add next
functionality:**
1. Add possibility to sort data within the table by columns ASC or
DESC (add simply two buttons on top of each columns to send
GET request to server like /index.php?colToSort=email&sort=ASC)
2. Use any of PDO::FETCH_? what you prefer
3. Implement search functionality (add one input field and try to
search using SQL “LIKE” statement)
*Note: Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection when inserting or updating*
*data into the database.*
*Consider adding some basic styling to the contact list and forms to improve the*
*user experience.*
